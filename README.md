Iâ€™m a Software Engineer focused on full-stack web development, having recently completed the intensive Makers Academy software engineering course. As a former senior engineer in the aerospace industry, I come with vast experience in leading teams of engineers through all stages of the development lifecycle, and so I know what it takes to achieve world-class delivery.

I have a methodical and analytical mindset, and a thirst for solving complex problems. Through Makers I have acquired the ability to code with industry best practices and I now look forward to being part of a dynamic and agile team, working on new challenges and building innovative digital technology.


## Tech Skills:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec and Sinatra
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, JQuery, Jasmine and Jest
- PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, MongoDB and Mongoose
- HTML and css

## Other Strengths

**Methodical Problem Solver:** Throughout my career I have logically structured problems and translated requirements into functional products, which is the core of any engineering discipline. Solving new, complex and interesting problems in digital tech is what excites me about being a software engineer.

**Experienced in Leadership:** As a senior systems engineer I had overall responsibility for ensuring products meet the technical specifications of the clients, usually with a team of 3-5 engineers. As such I'm able to effectively own tasks and deliver often in very time pressured situations.

**Accomplished Communicator:** A large part of being an engineer is being able to clearly communicate often complex technical concepts. The positions I've held have often required me to be the technical point of contact with clients, where effective communication was necessary to not only build relationships, but also to maintain the reputation of my company. 

## Projects

| Project           | Description    |
| ----------------- |----------------|
| [N.E.O.N](https://github.com/even13/game_of_life) <img src="images/neon.gif" width="600" /></div> | <ul><li>An alternative take on Conways Game of Life simulation, adding 2-player functionality, completed over 10 days, with agile at the core of team processes</li><li>This was my first React Project and provided a fantastic experience in learning to manage complex component and state structure in a React application</li><li>The experience gained from this project will help in better planning React component structures, thus reducing time spent refactoring. Additionally, with such complex state management in the app, Redux would have helped reduce complexity</li></ul>|
| [Stocks App](https://github.com/ajbacon/StocksApp) <img src="images/stocksapp.mov" width="600" /></div> | <ul><li>Post-Makers Personal Project to develop a full-stack JavaScript application, tracking stock markets and the general business world</li><li>The purpose is to gain a deeper understanding in building my own API, but also hit external API end points and learn modern React principles (with React hooks and redux)</li><li>The focus will be well thought-out, thoroughly tested code. Currently hosted on Heroku and CI/CD with Travis CI, this will be updated to AWS in due course</li><ul> |
| [SpaceBook](https://github.com/ajbacon/acebook-true-GrIT) <img src="images/stocksapp.mov" width="600" /></div> | <ul><li>A full-stack clone of Facebook, built with a Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL backend completed over 10 days, again, with agile at the core of team processes</li><li>This project was extremely helpful in establishing deeper understanding of fundamentals such as the MVC pattern, RESTful routes and managing database interactions through an ORM</li><li>My core responsibilities on the project were to setup authentication and create database relations in ActiveRecord for managing posts, friend requests, friends etc</li></ul> |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/ajbacon/bank_tech_test_rb) | <ul><li>REPL application mock tech test, practicing solid OO design and TDD principles</li></ul>|

## Other Interests

A county level tennis player when I was younger, I like to keep active! Football, tennis, golf, cricket, skiing, squash to name a few of the sports I like to play regularly.

Additionally, I love reading articles and blogs on engineering/tech related stuff, cooking, a good board game and before Makers I got slightly addicted to CodeWars!
