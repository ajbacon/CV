## Andrew Bacon

I've always loved problem solving, which lead me into a career in aerospace engineering. I've worked on some extremely interesting projects involving the design, analysis and testing of civil aircraft wings, large telecommunications satellites and even Royal Navy frigates and I'm proud that I have directly contributed to structures that float around in space and fly people around the world.

Since I was 18 and deciding what path to take on my career, I've changed and the world has changed. I gradually developed a love for coding during my career, it's a problem solving skill much like structural engineering. So I decided to learn the skill professionally through Makers. 

The technology scene in London offers a fast paced, vibrant and varied career. Having now completed Makers course, I'm looking to bring my previous experience, my newly aquired skills and ambition to the London tech scene.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Problem Solving
- Engineering is about creating a solution from a specification, or 'problem solving' this is true whether its for an aircraft or for a web application.
- expand on this

#### Communication
- Presenting technical data to customers and stakeholders
- Writing certification quality techical reports for aircraft and satellites

#### Team Player
- Worked on large scale projects where team work is essential

#### Accountability
- Technical lead roles
- Peoples lives or very expensive structure at risk
- Important to 

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
