I’m a full-stack software developer with a methodical, analytical mindset having developed a passion for coding on the back of a successful career in Aerospace Engineering.

Having reached the role of a senior systems engineer in the aerospace field, I have extensive experience in overseeing teams of engineers in the design, analysis and testing of complex satellite structures. Using these skills, as well as the solid coding processes I’ve acquired at Makers Academy, I want to work as part of a dynamic, agile team to solve new challenges and build innovative digital technology.

## Tech Skills:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec and Sinatra
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, JQuery, Jasmine and Jest
- PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, MongoDB and Mongoose
- HTML and css

## Other Strengths

**Methodical Problem Solver:** Throughout my career I have logically structured problems and translated requirements into functional products, which is the core of any engineering discipline. Solving new, complex and interesting problems in digital tech is what excites me about being a software engineer.

**Experienced in Leadership:** As a senior systems engineer I had overall responsibility for ensuring products meet the technical specifications of the clients, usually with a team of 3-5 engineers. As such I'm able to effectively own tasks and deliver often in very time pressured situations.

**Accomplished Communicator:** A large part of being an engineer is being able to cleary communicate often complex technical concepts. The positions I've held have often required me to be the technical point of contact with clients, where effective communication was necessary to not only build relationships, but also to maintain the reputation of my company.
