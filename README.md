## Who am I?

After a successful career in Aerospace Engineering, working for various leading engineering companies on a number of large-scale aircraft and satellite projects, I’ve taken the move to become a software developer. Developing software has always been an important part of my aerospace career, where autonomy and accuracy are critical for time efficient and robust designs, but what started out as a necessity has evolved into a passion.

In pursuit of this passion, my research led me to Makers where, having completed the 16 week intensive bootcamp course, I’ve had the chance to not only learn how to write clean, well tested, professional code, I have also met many like-minded, brilliant and engaging peers. The experience has ratified my decision to make the jump and energised me to start next chapter of my career.

In my aerospace career I reached senior engineer level, with management and system level responsibilities and while initially wanting to get as much hands on development experience as possible in an agile environment, in the long term I’m aiming for engineering manager or software architect roles to leverage my existing management and solution experience.

**Tech Skills:** JavaScript, Express, Node.js MongoDB, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS

## Skills

#### Excellent Problem Solver

The core of any engineering discipline is being able to logically structure and solve problems translating requirements and developing them into functional products. Personally, the most rewarding challenge I've faced was leading the design of a new satellite, which at 3.5tonnes, is 5x heavier than anything the company had produced previously. The step change in complexity was challenging for everyone, but these challenges are what excited me about working in aerospace and what inspire me to be a software engineer.

#### Experienced in Leadership

During the latter part of my aerospace career I had progressed to a mechanical systems (architect) role, with overall responsibility for ensuring the structure meets the technical specifications of the client and launch authority with a team of 3-5 engineers. In my more junior previous roles I have mentored new graduates and currently at Makers I am mentoring 3 students in the junior cohort.

#### Accomplished Communicator

All of my roles have required me to be in communication with the client, based on the client site and manage offshore colleagues. Communication was key to effective working but also building relationships, which eventually lead to future employment. In my latter system engineer role I was responsible for managing technical discussions with suppliers, stakeholders and presenting technical content at design acceptance reviews.
