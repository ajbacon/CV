I’ve recently completed the Makers Academy bootcamp after switching from a successful career in Aerospace Engineering to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about innovation and technology, which first led me into a career in Aerospace, however I knew that I wanted to move into a career that enabled me to be at the forefront of digital technology.

As a former Senior Systems engineer, I have extensive experience in leading teams of engineers in the design, analysis and testing of complex satellite structures. I have a methodical, analytical mindset, as well as solid coding processes acquired through Makers, and look forward to being part of a dynamic, agile team, solving new challenges and building innovative digital technology. 

## Tech Skills:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec and Sinatra
- JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, JQuery, Jasmine and Jest
- PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, MongoDB and Mongoose
- HTML and css

## Other Strengths

**Methodical Problem Solver:** Throughout my career I have logically structured problems and translated requirements into functional products, which is the core of any engineering discipline. Solving new, complex and interesting problems in digital tech is what excites me about being a software engineer.

**Experienced in Leadership:** As a senior systems engineer I had overall responsibility for ensuring products meet the technical specifications of the clients, usually with a team of 3-5 engineers. As such I'm able to effectively own tasks and deliver often in very time pressured situations.

**Accomplished Communicator:** A large part of being an engineer is being able to clearly communicate often complex technical concepts. The positions I've held have often required me to be the technical point of contact with clients, where effective communication was necessary to not only build relationships, but also to maintain the reputation of my company.

| [N.E.O.N](https://github.com/even13/game_of_life) | <ul><li>An alternative take on Conways Game of Life simulation, adding 2-player functionality, completed over 10 days, with agile at the core of team processes</li><li>This was my first React Project and provided a fantastic experience in learning to manage complex component and state structure in a React application</li><li>The experience gained from this project will help in better planning React component structures, thus reducing time spent refactoring. Additionally, with such complex state management in the app, Redux would have helped reduce complexity</li></ul>| JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Jest, Enzyme | Travis CI, Heroku, ESLint, Code Climate     |
| [SpaceBook](https://github.com/ajbacon/acebook-true-GrIT) | <ul><li>A full-stack clone of Facebook, built with a Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL backend completed over 10 days, again, with agile at the core of team processes</li><li>This project was extremely helpful in establishing deeper understanding of fundamentals such as the MVC pattern, RESTful routes and managing database interactions through an ORM</li><li>My core responsibilities on the project were to setup authentication and create database relations in ActiveRecord for managing posts, friend requests, friends etc</li></ul> | Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord (postgreSQL), RSpec, Capybara | Travis CI, Heroku, Rubocop, Code Climate |
| [Stocks App](https://github.com/ajbacon/StocksApp) | Personal Project to develop a full-stack JavaScript Application. This build is in its infancy but happy to discuss my plans for it. The focus will be further my knowledge of full stack javascript applications, hitting multiple end-points for a rich user experience.  Well thought-out, thoroughly tested code using CI/CD will be a priority throughout | JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, NodeJS, ReactJS, Jest, Enzyme, Supertest | Travis CI, Heroku, ESLint, Prettier, Code Climate      |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/ajbacon/bank_tech_test_rb) | REPL application mock tech test, practicing solid OO design and TDD principles                                                 | Ruby, RSpec, OOD | Rubocop     |

## Hobbies

A county level tennis player when I was younger, I like to keep active! Football, tennis, golf, cricket, skiing, squash to name a few of the sports I like to play regularly.

Additionally, I love reading articles and blogs on engineering/tech related stuff, cooking, a good board game and before Makers I got slightly addicted to CodeWars!
